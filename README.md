#### Wishlist / Ran out of Time

A couple of items that I wanted to get to but ran out of time:

- A modal that announces that Thuumper is in closed beta when users try to sign up
- Use of Nuxt Color Mode module to trigger light/dark modes
- End to end testing for MVP flows using Cypress
- Loading states
- More validation of email & password prior to using backend services
- More components
- Reusable logic
- Further Storybook customization/add-ons
